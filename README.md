The objective of this project was to predict the approval status of credit card applications using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains information on various attributes of credit card applicants, such as gender, education level, occupation, and status of credit history. The task is to build a model that can accurately predict whether an application will be approved or denied based on these attributes. In other words, the objective is to predict if an applicant is a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ client, but the definition of good and bad is not given. Our main task is to build a label for these clients using our own criteria. 

The reason why we used this dataset is based on a number of factors, including its practicality and the potential business applications of the insights we could gain from analyzing it. We first considered using the avocado dataset that we found in Kaggle, we thought it would have been interesting to analyze the industry, but then we concluded that the credit card dataset made more sense. The selected dataset allowed us to analyze an industry that is relevant to a wide range of businesses and even also to individuals, and it offered a more comprehensive set of data to work with. 

Overall, this report provides insights into the factors that contribute to credit card approval and demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques for credit risk assessment. Moreover, we believe that our analysis of the credit card dataset can have broader implications for businesses and financial institutions. Our findings could help businesses to make more informed decisions about credit card approvals and improve their risk management strategies. By contrast, while analyzing the avocado dataset could have provided insights into that particular industry, we concluded that it would not have been as useful in terms of practical applications and real-world impact.
